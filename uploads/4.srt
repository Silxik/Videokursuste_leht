Hello everyone!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
In this tutorial, what I'm gonna do is

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,100
give you a really quick basic introduction to the PHP language

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,100
and I'm not gonna go over everything there is to know about the PHP language

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,100
but I feel that if you wanna learn how to code PHP

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
there are several components to PHP that you should be aware of.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So let's just go ahead and get started here,

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
it's not gonna take too long.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So first of all, what is PHP?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If someone walks up to you and asks:

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,500
"Hey what is PHP? What does it stand for?"

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, you should be able to respond with:

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:39,000
"Well, PHP is a hypertext preprocessor!"

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:40,900
So they gonna pretty much think you're pretty smart

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to know what you are talking about.
